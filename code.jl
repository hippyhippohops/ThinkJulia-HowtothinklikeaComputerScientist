In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a 
function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you call the function by it's name. 

The expression in the parenthesis of the function is called the argument of the function. It is common to say that a function 
takes in an argument and returns a result. The result is also called the return value. 


There are 2 types of functions:
(i) Inbulit Functions
(ii) New Functions

println("ARRAYS")

#=
We will explore one of Julia's bulit-in types: array

Like a string, an array is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters. In an array, they can be 
any type. The elements in an array are called elements or sometimes items. 
=#

# Arrays are mutable

The syntax for accessing the elements of an array is the same as for accessing the characters of a string - using the 
bracket operator.

numbers[2] = 5
println("After reassignment, the array numbers is: ", numbers)

# Transversing an Array
# The most common way to transverse the elements of an array is with a for loop:

    println(cheese)
end

""" Chapter 11: Dictionaries """

println("DICTIONARIES")

#=
Another built-in type is called a dictionary. A dictionary is like an array, but more general. In an array, the indices
have to be integers; in a dictionary, they can be almost any type. 

A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called keys, and a collection of values. Each key is associated 
with a single value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair, or sometimes an item. 

In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a mapping from keys to values, so you can also say that each key "maps to"
a value. 
=#

# Creating a new dictionary
eng2sp = Dict()
println("The new dictionary, named, eng2sp is: ", eng2sp)

# To add items to the dictionary
eng2sp["one"] = "uno"
println("After adding a key-value pair, eng2sp is: ", eng2sp)

eng2sp["three"] = "tres"
println("After adding a key-value pair, eng2sp is: ", eng2sp)
println("The value associated to key two is: ", eng2sp["two"])

#= You can transverse the keys of a dictionary in a for statement
function printhist(h)
    for c in keys(h)
        println(c, " ", h[c])
    end
end
h = histogram("parrot")
println("h is: ", h)
printhist(h)
=#

""" Chapter 12: Tuples """

println("TUPLES")

#=
This chapter presents one more inbulid tuple: the Tuple. 

A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. 
So, they are a lot like arrays, but the important difference is that tuples are immutable.

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:
=#
t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
println("The tuple t is: ", t)

# Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples i brackets
t1 = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
println("The tuple t1 is: ", t1)

# To create a tuple with a single element, you need to include a final comma
t1 = ('a',)
println("The new t1 is: ", t1)
println("The type of t1 is: ", typeof(t1))

# Most array operations work on tuples
# Indexing
println("We select the first element in t: ", t[1])

# Slicing
println("We select the 2nd to 4th element in t: ", t[2:4])

#=
Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, 
the effect is the same as returning multiple values.
=#
q, r = divrem(7, 3)
println("When 7 is divided by 3, the quotient is ", q, "and the remainder is ", r)

#= 
Functions can take in any number of arguments. A parameter name that ends with ...
gathers arguments into a tuple. For example, the following function takes any number 
of arguments and prints them:
=#
function printall(args...)
    println("The parameters of the function are: ", args)
end
printall(1, 2.0, '3')

#=
The complement of gather is scatter. If you have a sequence of values and you want to pass it to a function
with multiple arguments, you can use the ... operator. For example, divrem takes in 2 arguments. so given
=#
t = (7, 3)
# divrem(t) will not work. But the following will:
println("divem(t...) will output: ", divrem(t...) )

#= 
Zip is a built-in function that takes 2 or more sequences and returns a collection of tuples where each tuple
contains one element from each sequence.
=#
s = "abc"
println("String s is: ", s)
t = [1,2,3]
println("Array t is: ", t)
println("Zipping s and t will give us: ", zip(s,t))
# Note that the result is a zip object which knows how to iterate through the pairs. The most common use of zip is in a for loop:
for pair in zip(s,t)
    println("The pairs in the zip are: ", pair)
end




""" Chapter 15: Structs and Objects """

println("STRUCTS AND OBJECTS")

#= 
Thus far, we have seen how to use functions to organise code and how to use bulit in 
types to organise data. 
Now, we will learn how to build our own types to organise both code and data.

Now, we are going to define a type. As an example, we will create a type called Point
that will represent a point in two-dimensional space. 

We could do the following:
(i) We could store the coordinates separately in two variables. 
(ii) We could store the coordinates as elements in an array or tuple
(iii) We could create a new type to represent points as objects

Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages 
that will soon be apparent. 
=#

# A user defined composite type is also called a struct. 
#=
We have constructed a struct (user defined composite type) called Point with 2 attributes/fields: x and y. 
A struct is similar to a class/object in OOP.
=#
struct Point
    x
    y
end

#= 
Tocreate a point, you call Point as if it were a function having arguments the values of fields. 
When a struct is used as a function, like below, it is called a Constructor:
=#
p = Point(3.0,4.0) 
#=
Creating a new object is called instantiation, and the object of an instance is of the type.
When you print an instance, Julia tells you what type it belongs to and what the values of the attributes are.
For our p, which we defined as above, prints to give us:
=#
println("Our struct, p, is: ", p) # The return value is a reference to a Pointobject, which we assign to p. 

# Getting values of Structs
println("The x attribute of p is: ", p.x)
println("The y attribute of p is: ", p.y)

# We can use the dot notation as part of any expression.
distance = sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
println("The distance of point from the origin is: ", distance)

# Mutable Structs 
#=
Structs are immutable. After the construction of a struct, the fields cannot change value. 
When required, mutable composite typees can be declared with the keyword mutable struct, as seen
below:
=# 
mutable struct MPoint
    x 
    y
end
blank = MPoint(0.0,0.0)
println("Our mutable struct, blank, is: ", blank)
println("The x attribute of blank is: ", blank.x)
println("The y attribute of blank is: ", blank.y)
blank.x = 3.0
blank.y = 4.0
println("Our mutable struct, blank, is now: ", blank)
println("The x attribute of blank is now: ", blank.x)
println("The y attribute of blank is now: ", blank.y)


"""
We will construct another example of a struct, a rectangle. 
This struct represents a rectangle and will be described by 
the following fields: Width, Height, Corner. 
"""
struct Rectangle
    width 
    height
    corner
end
origin = MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
println("The point of origin of the rectangle, ie the corner, is: ", origin)
box = Rectangle(100.0,200.0, origin)
println("The rectangle (with corner (0,0), width 100 and height 200) is: ",box)

# Instances as Arguments - you can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way
#=
Recall that instances are objects that are copies of our class/struct. Therefore, this
tells us that we can pass our instances as arguments in our functions. 

Recall that here, p = Point(3.0,4.0), an instance of our struct/class called point.
We are defining a function called printpoint that takes in an instance of our struct/class 
called point as an argument, and displays it in the conventional mathematical notation.
=#
function printpoint(p)
    println("The mathematical notion of our struct called point ,p, is: ","($(p.x), $(p.y))")
end
printpoint(blank)

# To define the distance function above as a function
function distance_new(p)
    println("The new distance of point from the origin is: ", sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2))
end
new_point = Point(7.5,8.3)
distance_new(new_point)

#= 
If a mutable struct is passed as an argument to a function as an argument, the function 
can modify the fields of the object.

Here, movepoint! takes a mutable Point object and 2 numbers, dx and dy, and adds the numbers 
to x and y attributes respectively. 

=#
function movepoint!(p, dx, dy)
    p.x += dx
    p.y += dy
    nothing
end
origin = MPoint(0.0, 0.0)
println("The coordinates of the original point is: ", origin)
movepoint!(origin, 1.0, 2.0)
println("After moving the point, the coordinates of the point is: ", origin)

#=
Not only can functions take in instances as arguments, they can also return instances. 

In the example below, findcenter takes a rectangle as an argument and returns a Point that 
contains the coordinates of the center of the rectangle, which is an object/instance of class
Point:
=#
function findcenter(rect)
    Point(rect.corner.x + rect.width / 2, rect.corner.y + rect.height / 2)
end
center = findcenter(box) # We want to find the center of the rect called box
println("The center of the rect called box is:", center)

""" Chapter 16: Structs and Functions """

#= 
Now, that we know how to create new composite types, the next step is to write functions 
that can take programmer-defined objects (ie structs) and return them as results. 

Here, we will also explore functional programming style and 2 new program development plans.
=#

# As another example, we will define a struct called MyTime, which records the time of the day:
struct MyTime
    hour
    minute 
    second
end

# We will create a new MyTime object called:
time = MyTime(11,59,30)
println("The MyTime object called time is: ", time)

#= 
Now, we will write two functions that add time values. They demonstrate 2 kinds of functions:
(i) Pure Functions
(ii) Modifiers

They also demonstrate a development plan called prototype and patch, which is a way of tackling
a complex problem by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with complications. 
=#

# Here is a simple prototype of addtime:
#=
This function creates a new MyTime object, initialises its fields, and returns a reference to the
new object.

This is called a Pure Function as 
(i) it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments 
(ii) it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value. 
=#
function addtime(t1, t2)
    MyTime(t1.hour + t2.hour, t1.minute + t2.minute, t1.second + t2.second )
end

# Exercise 16-1
function printtime(t1)
    x = t1.hour
    y = t1.minute
    z = t1.second
    println("Time printed: ", x:y:z)
end
example_of_time = MyTime(11, 59, 30)
printtime(example_of_time) # THIS IS INCORRECT CHECK WHY


# To test the function 
start = MyTime(9, 45, 0)
duration = MyTime(1, 35, 0)
done = addtime(start,duration)
println("The movie ends at: ", done)
printtime(done) # THIS IS INCORRECT CHECK WHY

#=
Note that we have 80s. So, we need an improved version, where whenever the min or sec > 60, we need to carry over
the extra time
=#

function addtime(t1, t2)
    second = t1.second + t2.second
    minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    if second >= 60
        second -= 60
        minute += 1
    end
    if minute >= 60
        minute -= 60
        hour += 1
    end
    MyTime(hour, minute, second)
end
done = addtime(start,duration)
println("The movie ends at: ", done)

#= 
Sometimes, it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as parameters. In that case, the changes
are visible to the caller. Functions that work this way are called modifiers.

An example is the following function:
=#

function increment!(time,seconds)
    time.second += seconds
    if time.second >= 60
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1
    end
    if time.minute >= 60
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1
    end
end
# However, it may not necessarily be enough to carry over once. We have to keep doing it till seconds < 60

function increment!(time,seconds)
    time.second += seconds
    while time.second >= 60
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1
    end
    while time.minute >= 60
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1
    end
end

""" Chapter 17: Multiple Dispatch """

println("MULTIPLE DISPATCH")

#= 
In Julia, you have the ability to write code that can operate on different types. This is called "generic programming".
Here, a method that offer ways to implement different behaviour for a function depending on the types of their arguments
will be introduced. This is called multiple dispatch. 
=#

# :: operator attaches type annotations to expressions and variables, indicating what types they should have
(1+2) :: Int64
# This helps us check if my program works the way we expect it too

# The :: operator can also be appended to the lefthand side of an assignment, or included part of a declaration:
function returnfloat()
    x::Float64 = 100
    x
end
x = returnfloat()
println("x is: ", x)
println("The type of x is: ", typeof(x))

# A type annotation can also be attached to the header of a function definition
function sinc(x)::Float64
    if x == 0
